# Byte Pack

> Bulk-download images open in separate browser tabs with one click.

Byte Pack is a Chrome and Microsoft Edge extension for designers, researchers,
and anyone who opens images in separate tabs and wants to save them all at once
without right-clicking each one individually.

---

## Features

- **One-click Quick Save** — scans all open tabs and downloads every image instantly
- **Smart detection** — identifies image tabs by URL extension and HTTP Content-Type header
- **Clean filenames** — timestamped names with correct file extensions, no conflicts
- **Proactive scan** — shows how many image tabs are ready before you click anything
- **Theme system** — Windows 11, macOS, and System Default themes, auto-detected on install
- **Settings panel** — manual theme override, persisted across devices via browser sync

---

## Installation (Developer Mode)

Byte Pack is not yet published to the Chrome Web Store or Edge Add-ons.
To run it locally:

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions` or Edge and go to `edge://extensions`
3. Enable **Developer Mode**
4. Click **Load unpacked**
5. Select the `byte-pack/` folder

The extension will appear in your toolbar immediately.

## How It Works

1. Open images in separate tabs — direct image URLs like `domain.com/photo.jpg`
2. Click the **Byte Pack** icon in the toolbar
3. The popup shows how many image tabs were detected
4. Click **Quick Save** — all images download to your default downloads folder
